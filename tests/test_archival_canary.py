"""Dry-run coverage for script/archival-canary.sh (#1863).

The canary is the only thing that can close docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1: it is
the live-network archival/restore round trip, and it runs against a real probe
contract, so it cannot run in CI. That is exactly why it needs a dry run here —
the script is the *mechanism* for detecting archival problems, and a script that
has drifted out of step with the probe (wrong key XDR, wrong entry point name,
wrong ledger arithmetic) fails silently in the one place nobody is watching.

The previous coverage was `bash -n`, which proves the file parses and nothing
else: a script that invoked the wrong contract method, or that computed
"remaining" the wrong way round, passed.

So this module runs the script for real, against stubbed network boundaries:

* a fake `curl` answering the `getLatestLedger` JSON-RPC call with a chosen
  ledger sequence — that is the only network input the status path needs;
* a fake `stellar` that fails, standing in for the CLI reporting an archived
  entry, so the archived branch runs too.

Both branches then execute end to end offline, and their exit codes and output
are asserted. The restore branch is deliberately *not* driven here: it submits
transactions, and a stub that "succeeds" would prove nothing about a real
network.
