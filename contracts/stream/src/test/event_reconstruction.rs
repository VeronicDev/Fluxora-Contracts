//! Issue #1868 — the emitted event stream, on its own, must be enough for an
//! off-chain indexer to reconstruct every stream's state.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The contract keeps no per-party index — see the `lib.rs` module docs — so
//! "which streams are mine" can only be answered by indexing the events. That
//! makes the events load-bearing infrastructure, and the property they have to
//! hold is *reconstructability*: replaying the events alone, with no access to
//! `get_stream`, has to yield exactly the state the contract holds in storage.
//!
//! The existing event tests (`test::events`, `test::withdraw_events`,
//! `test::cancel_events`) each check one event kind against one operation. None
//! of them folds a whole history back into a `Stream`, which is the property
//! the issue actually asks for and the only one that catches a field that moved
//! in one event but is never republished in the next.
//!
//! # What is asserted here
//!
//! 1. [`reconstruction_from_events_alone_matches_storage`] replays a generated
//!    operation history — one that touches every state-changing entry point —
//!    through a fold that reads *only* event payloads, then compares **every**
//!    field of **every** reconstructed stream against `get_stream`.
//! 2. The same fold asserts, for each event, that it exposes the stream id and
//!    both parties of the stream *as it stands after that event*, so a consumer
//!    can route "streams that involve me" from any single event and not only
//!    from `stream_created`.
//! 3. The history records the event kind published by each call, which is the
//!    machine-checked form of "every state-changing entry point emits an
//!    event": a call that publishes nothing fails the step assertion, and a
//!    call that is never exercised fails the coverage assertion at the end.
//! 4. [`a_missing_field_breaks_reconstruction`] folds the same history with the
//!    pre-#1868 event schema — the one in which `withdrawn` and `cancelled` do
//!    not republish the pause bookkeeping — and requires the result to diverge,
//!    naming the fields involved. [`every_reconstructed_field_is_checked`]
//!    proves the comparator behind it is field-complete by mutating each field
//!    in turn.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! `Stream` carries `paused_at` and `paused_total`, and two entry points move
//! them without a `paused`/`resumed` event of their own:
//!
//! * a `withdraw` that drains a *paused* stream to zero folds the in-progress
//!   pause into `paused_total` and clears `paused_at` (`lib.rs`,
//!   `apply_withdrawal`), and
//! * `cancel` clears `paused_at` on a stream that was paused at the time.
//!
//! Neither `withdrawn` nor `cancelled` used to publish either field, so an
//! event-only indexer kept a `paused_at` the contract had already dropped and a
//! `paused_total` it had already moved. Both events now republish the pair, and
//! the events that named only one side of the stream now name both; this module
//! is what holds them to it. Its measurements are also what justify the
//! event-byte budget re-derived in `test::resource_limits`.
