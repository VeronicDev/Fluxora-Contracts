//! Issue #1854 — two delegates withdrawing concurrently in the same ledger.
//!
//! `WITHDRAW` grants are stored per `(stream_id, delegate)`, so a recipient can
//! issue two independent delegates the permission to withdraw from the *same*
//! stream — a payroll service and a treasury keeper, say. Both may transact in
//! the same ledger, and each call reads the stream fresh from storage before it
//! pays, so settlement is **serialised by storage**: whichever call executes
//! first pays only what was available at its read, and the second sees the
//! updated `withdrawn` and is paid only the remainder. Double settlement would
//! be a second full payout against a stale balance.
//!
//! # What these tests assert
//!
//! Both orderings are exercised end to end through the public ABI:
//!
//! 1. **Delegate A first** — A drains the full balance; B, ordered after it,
//!    is rejected with `NothingToWithdraw` (17) (the stream is still `Active`,
//!    never terminal, so the empty-balance distinction applies — see
//!    `docs/ABI.md`, the `withdraw` error table).
//! 2. **Delegate B first** — B takes a partial payout; A, ordered after it,
//!    drains exactly the remainder. The two payouts sum to the vested amount
//!    with nothing paid twice.
//!
//! In both orderings:
//!
//! * **Funds conservation** holds exactly: the recipient's token gain sums to
//!   the vested amount at the shared ledger instant, the pool drops by the
//!   same figure, and the pre-settlement `vested + refundable == deposited`
//!   identity holds.
//! * **Accounting and events** match: the `withdrawn` events are the only
//!   stream events, each publishes its own payout, and the second event's
//!   cumulative `withdrawn` equals the first's payout plus its own. Topics
//!   carry the stream's *current* recipient — both delegates pay the holder of
//!   the recipient slot, never the delegate itself.
//! * **Final stream state** matches the documented one: `withdrawn == vested`,
//!   `status == Active` while a positive liability remains (flipping to
//!   `Depleted` exactly once when the deposit settles), and the pool holds
//!   exactly the outstanding liability (`Harness::assert_pool_exact`).
