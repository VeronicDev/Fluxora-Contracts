//! `delegate_withdraw` at the edges its direct counterpart `withdraw` already
//! covers.
//!
//! `test::withdraw` pins the direct path exhaustively: the amount domain
//! (`InvalidAmount`, `InsufficientWithdrawable`), the terminal guards, the
//! status transitions, the payout/accounting identity, and the events. Most of
//! that is mirrored for `delegate_withdraw` in `test::delegation`, which pins
//! the replicated amount domain, the terminal guards, the permission bit, the
//! expiry window and same-ledger revocation.
//!
//! This file closes the remaining asymmetry between the two entry points:
//!
//! * **Guard ordering.** `withdraw` loads the stream first and reports
//!   `StreamNotFound` for an unknown id; `delegate_withdraw` validates the
//!   *grant* first, so the same call reports `DelegateNotPermitted`. That is
//!   deliberate — a caller who holds no grant learns nothing about which ids
//!   exist — and it is pinned here so it cannot change silently.
//! * **The delegate's own authorization.** A live grant is necessary but not
//!   sufficient: the delegate named in the call must still authorise it. Without
//!   this the grant table alone would let anyone spend a recipient's claim by
//!   naming themselves a delegate.
//! * **The expiry boundary.** A grant is valid *at* its `expires_at` ledger and
//!   dead one second later, matching the direct path's maturity boundaries.
//! * **The cancelled-with-tail path.** A cancelled stream still owes its accrued
//!   tail, and its delegate can still collect it.
//! * **Payout equivalence.** A delegated withdrawal produces the same payout,
//!   the same resulting record and the same events as the direct call.
