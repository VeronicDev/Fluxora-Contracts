/// **Boundary: pause landing exactly on the cliff instant**

/// Issue #1830. The cliff gate is evaluated on the stream clock,
/// `stream_time(now) = (paused_at ?? now) - paused_total`. A `pause` call whose
/// ledger timestamp equals `cliff_time` is the single instant where the two
/// clocks meet while the stream is still gated, because the freeze point and
/// the gate satisfy `paused_at == cliff_time` with `paused_total == 0`.
/// Whether the gate is then open or shut is decided purely by the comparison
/// inside `cliff_reached` — `<` versus `<=` — and both wrong directions break
/// real value:
///
/// * `<` (gate treated as shut): the frozen clock sits exactly at `cliff_time`
///   and can never rise while paused, so the recipient can never withdraw —
///   not at the pause, not at the wall-clock cliff, and not after a resume,
///   which lands the stream clock back on `cliff_time` exactly.
/// * `>` (gate treated as open early): identical arithmetic opens the gate a
///   second before an un-paused stream would.
///
/// The contract documents `stream_time >= cliff_time` in docs/ABI.md's `resume`
/// section and pins the same rule for the in-progress pause in the `pause`
/// section ("the recipient can still withdraw value accrued before the
/// pause"). This test exercises the equality case end to end through the
/// public ABI — pause, withdraw while frozen, resume, continued accrual —
/// asserting accounting, emitted events and the final stream state.
